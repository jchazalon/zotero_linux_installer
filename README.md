# zotero_linux_installer: Installer for Zotero standalone on Linux platforms.
**A simple tool to ease Zotero installation under Linux. Automating the strict minimum. Single script. Easy to maintain.**

## About
This is a modified fork from [smathot's script](https://github.com/smathot/zotero_installer) to
avoid automatic download from the official website.

Instead, the user can download and install the file he wants easily.
I found this solution a bit more stable along Zotero releases.

Also, this script does a better job a cleaning temporary data.

As previous work was released under the GPL v2 licence, I use the same
licence, while I am not really sure it makes really sense in my countryâ€¦
So, make sure what this script does is right for you before running it.
And then do whatever you want with it.

Tested for:

- The default install location is under `/opt`. Just edit the script to change it.
